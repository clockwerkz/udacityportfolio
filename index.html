I chose to highlight some of the projects I had worked on prior to the NanoDegree.<br> This sample portfolio was built using html/css with no frameworks. I used flex-box for the layout. </p> <div class="project-card__footer"> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://clockwerkz.github.io/udacityproject01/">Live Project</a> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clockwerkz/udacityproject01">GitHub Repo</a> </div> </div>  </div>  <div class="project-card"> <div class="project-card__image project-2"></div> <div class="project-card__body"> <h2 class="project-card__title">Memory Matching Game</h2> <p class="project__text"> The second project is a Memory Matching Game that's written in JavaScript. For the project, we were given the board and the font icons, and were required to build the functionality. Features include a timer, a star rating based on number of guesses, and restart/replay button. </p> <div class="project-card__footer"> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://clockwerkz.github.io/jsMemoryGame/">Live Project</a> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clockwerkz/jsMemoryGame">GitHub Repo</a> </div> </div>  </div>  <div class="project-card"> <div class="project-card__image project-3"></div> <div class="project-card__body"> <h2 class="project-card__title">Bugs -N- Gems Game</h2> <p class="project__text"> Creating a classic Frogger clone game using a basic JavaScript engine was our third project. The only victory condition was for the player to reach the top of the board, and the lose condition is being hit by a bug.<br> I added additional elements such as levels, rocks as obstacles that randomly spawn in, gems to collect, and a countdown timer that will end the game. </p> <div class="project-card__footer"> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://clockwerkz.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/">Live Project</a> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clockwerkz/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game">GitHub Repo</a> </div> </div>  </div>  <div class="project-card"> <div class="project-card__image project-4"></div> <div class="project-card__body"> <h2 class="project-card__title">FeedReader Testing</h2> <p class="project__text"> The fourth project served as an introduction into Unit Testing using Jasmine. Through the classes, we learned how to use describe blocks and it/expects to test different values and expectations. We also learned how to do asyncronous testing.<br> At the end of the section, we were to complete the required tests for a feed reader app. </p> <div class="project-card__footer project-card__footer--solo"> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clockwerkz/udacity_feed_reader">GitHub Repo</a> </div> </div>  </div>  <div class="project-card"> <div class="project-card__image project-5"></div> <div class="project-card__body"> <h2 class="project-card__title">Restaurant Reviews Project</h2> <p class="project__text"> For our fifth project, we were challenged to improve an existing website and implement new features. We were tasked with implementing accessibility improvements, as well as incorporating a service worker for off-line use. Using Google Chrome's silverlight testing, I aimed to improve the overall usability score for the site. </p> <div class="project-card__footer"> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://clockwerkz.github.io/restaurant_reviews_project/">Live Project</a> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clockwerkz/restaurant_reviews_project">GitHub Repo</a> </div> </div>  </div>  <div class="project-card"> <div class="project-card__image project-6"></div> <div class="project-card__body"> <h2 class="project-card__title">My Reads React Project</h2> <p class="project__text"> The sixth project was our first React assignment. The assignment involved a bookreads API that keeps track of the status of books in our inventory. We were responsible for using React to keep track of the status of our book inventory. We also made use of React Routing to add a search page to find more books to add to the library. </p> <div class="project-card__footer"> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://clockwerkz.github.io/MyReads/">Live Project</a> <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clockwerkz/MyReads">GitHub Repo</a> </div> </div>  </div>  </div>  </div> </section>  <footer> <p class="footer__text">Made By Carlos Fins 2019</p> </footer> <script src="js.63c04716.js"></script> </body> </html>
