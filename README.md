[Carlos Fins Udacity Portfolio](https://clockwerkz.github.io/udacityportfolio/)<br>
## Background 
I compiled this Portfolio to highlight the projects I completed while enrolled in the Front End Developer Nanodegree last year. I was both a Phase 1 and Phase 2 Google Scholarship Recipient, and completed the program.<br>
In addition to the course study, I was active in the program's Slack Channel, offering assistance to fellow student peers. I was made a Student Leader and conducted various Webinars to demo Projects and programming Concepts through Udacity's Youtube Channel.

## Udacity Mentor <br>(Front End Developer Nanodegree)
I am currently a mentor for Udacity, assisting students through the Front End Developer and the Intro To Computer Science NanoDegrees.<br>
My mentor duties include hosting 1:1s with the students, covering lessons, developing action plans to complete the courses, and offer technical help and knowledge. I review assignments before submission to help students with any problems in their project. <br>
In addition to providing mentoring for the students, I also assist with beta testing new courses.
